## Install

### Chrome Web Store (recommended)

1. **Click the extension icon** → opens the recording page
2. **Pick your source** — entire screen, window, or tab
3. **(Optional)** Enable camera overlay and/or microphone

7. **Export** — download a polished video file

## Architecture

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `manifest.json` | Chrome extension manifest (Manifest V3) |
| `background.js` | Service worker — recording lifecycle, tab management, camera relay |
| `content.js` | Injected into pages — tracks cursor, clicks, keystrokes |
| `record.js` / `record.html` | Recording page UI — source picker, camera/mic setup |
| `recorder.js` | Injected into the recorded tab — runs `MediaRecorder` |
| `editor.js` / `editor.html` | Post-recording editor — zoom preview, trim, export |
| `video-processor.js` | Canvas-based export pipeline — zoom, click effects, backgrounds |
| `zoom-analyzer.js` | Click-aware zoom segment generation with easing curves |
| `popup.js` / `popup.html` / `popup.css` | Toolbar popup — quick start/stop |
| `offscreen.js` / `offscreen.html` | Offscreen document for `MediaRecorder` fallback |

## Privacy

- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind
- No external network requests (after install)
